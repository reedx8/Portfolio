- adding to the README, and rereading the final project guidelines to get a better understanding of the assignment. I then worked on getting a general outline of both what exact text content i would be using (eg describing myself in the about section) and general layout (eg ill use a one page website with sections to jump to, how i want each section to look, etc)
